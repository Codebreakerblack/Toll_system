# Toll_system

This project models a toll system where vehicles are charged based on their type when passing through a toll station. Each toll station has a name, a city location, and a value representing the total toll collected.

## Problem Description

The toll system works as follows:

- **Toll Stations**:
  - Each toll station has a name and a city where it is located.
  - It also has a value representing the total toll collected.

- **Vehicles**:
  - Vehicles that arrive at a toll station have a registration plate.
  - The toll charge depends on the vehicle type:
    - **Car**: The toll charge is $100.
    - **Motorcycle**: The toll charge is $50.
    - **Truck**: The toll charge depends on the number of axles. The toll is $50 for each axle.

## Requirements

- The toll station calculates the toll charge for each vehicle that arrives.
- The station also keeps track of the total toll collected throughout the day.
- At the end of the simulation, the system will print a list of all vehicles that passed through the toll and the total toll collected.

## Features

- Vehicle type-based toll calculation.
- Accumulation of total toll for the day.
- List of all vehicles and their corresponding toll charges.
